# Reginode
Register and Login in NodeJS

This project is intended to be just for myself to learn NodeJS, not a totally secure and rigid register and login system; but hopefully, this project can be helpful for others who just want simple backend functionality.

# practices

- Capitalize the first letter of the name of classes and interfaces
- Use semicolon after every variable name
